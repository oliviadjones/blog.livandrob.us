    <h1 class="post-title">A Weekend in Yosemite</h1>
    <section class="post-content">
      <p>######For some reason, the first time I visited Yosemite I absolutely <em>could not</em> get around the pronunciation.</p>
<p>I mean, it really does look like it should be pronounced like <em>Vegemite</em> <em>(Yaw-seh-mite)</em> - does anyone else have this problem?? No? </p>
<p>Just me then.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion (mine) I actually had to start referring to it as <em>“Yozzie”</em> with my Australian friends. </p>
<p>With Americans I just avoided pronouncing it all together.</p>
<p>So, in 2010 I took a bus up the Big Sur from LA to San Francisco and on the way back I was lucky enough to stop at <em>“Yozzie”</em>. My stay was <em>much</em> too brief and I didn’t really get to explore. But the majesty and the spirit of this incredible place stayed with me and I’ve always wanted to go back. </p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0114.jpg" alt="&quot;Yaw-seh-mite” (like vegemite)" title="&quot;Yaw-seh-mite” (like vegemite)"></p>
<p>And last weekend I did! With these two lovely people. Rob and my sister May, visiting from Sydney (so nice to have an excuse to be a tourist!)…</p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0024.jpg" alt="Rob and May at the start of Mist" title="Rob and May at the start of Mist"></p>
<p>With Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson making it to the top of El Capitan this week (<a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/01/15/377526987/yosemite-dawn-wall-climbers-reach-the-top-after-19-days" target="_blank" rel="external">I love this NPR interview with them from the summit last week!</a>) - I thought I’d share some shots from our experience of this beautiful national park.</p>
<p>###Nevada Fall Trail<br>Heading out from the John Muir Trail-head carpark, we originally wanted to take the short Mist Trail but it was closed for Winter. So we took the longer Nevada Fall Trail instead.</p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0122.jpg" alt="Trails from John Muir Trail-head carpark" title="Trails from John Muir Trail-head carpark"></p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0026.jpg" alt="View from the Nevada Falls Trail" title="View from the Nevada Falls Trail"></p>
<p>###Detour to Vernal Fall<br>About a mile in we found the rest of the way closed. So we took .6mi trail down to Vernal Falls.</p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0062.jpg" alt="Oh no! It&#39;s closed" title="Oh no! It&#39;s closed"></p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0063.jpg" alt="Going down" title="Going down"></p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0065.jpg" alt="Going down" title="Going down"></p>
<p>Ice at the top of Vernal Fall - no swimming unfortunately…</p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0073.jpg" alt="No swimming" title="No swimming"></p>
<p>At the end of the trail was this beautiful piece of epicness, not too shabby! </p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0070.jpg" alt="View from the top of the Vernal Falls Trail" title="View from the top of the Vernal Falls Trail"></p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0076.jpg" alt="View from the top of the Vernal Falls Trail" title="View from the top of the Vernal Falls Trail"></p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0078.jpg" alt="View from the top of the Vernal Falls Trail" title="View from the top of the Vernal Falls Trail"></p>
<p>###Mist Trail<br>We then saw that the Mist Trail was indeed open - hmm, and also fricking steep! Kind of lucked out there. </p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0079.jpg" alt="Mist Trail from the top of the Vernal Falls Trail" title="Mist Trail from the top of the Vernal Falls Trail"></p>
<p>We took it down instead… </p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0086.jpg" alt="The way down" title="The way down"></p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0085.jpg" alt="The way down" title="The way down"></p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0089.jpg" alt="The way down" title="The way down"></p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0091.jpg" alt="The way down" title="The way down"></p>
<p>for some more epic views…</p>

<p>and waterfall action (That’s snow at the bottom!)</p>

<p>###About 10km in total!</p>
<p>The Sierra Nevada that runs 400mi from Northern California south down the California/ Nevada state line is home to spiritual, majestic and awe-inspiring natural monuments like Lake Tahoe and Yosemite. </p>
<p>It is essential North California visiting!!</p>
<p>And <em>Sierra Nevada</em> means ‘Snowy Mountains’ in Spanish - so its like Australians were born to love it.</p>
<p>###Some details…</p>
<ul>
<li>Yosemite National Park is a 3 to 4 hour drive from San Francisco</li>
<li>Entrance into the park is $USD20 per car (there are individual prices if you’re biking in)</li>
<li>We had a great experience in what I assume is someone’s holiday home via Airbnb. I love staying in a rented home - there are perks like tips on local brunch places and the occassional discovery of Scrabble or Trivial Pursuit in the linen closet (both pretty awesome with a few sneaky glasses of red #justsaying)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Airbnb (outside of the park itself) - which was soooooo cute. Laura Ingalls’ Little House in the Big Woods anyone?!</p>
<p><img src="/img/Airbnb.jpg" alt="our Airbnb" title="our Airbnb"></p>
<p><strong>Back to the park,</strong> The drive out is actually really beautiful in itself. We had this fantastic view of <em>El Capitan</em>… </p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0129.jpg" alt="Yosemite" title="Yosemite"></p>
<p>and the sun on a rock formation called <em>The Three Brothers</em>…</p>
<p><img src="/img/DSC_0127.jpg" alt="Yosemite" title="Yosemite"></p>
<p>Also, we had to stop for this deer family crossing the road…</p>
<p><img src="/img/1.jpg" alt="Deer family - driving in to Yosemite National Park" title="Deer family - driving in to Yosemite National Park"></p>
<p><img src="/img/2.jpg" alt="Deer family - driving in to Yosemite National Park" title="Deer family - driving in to Yosemite National Park"></p>
<p><img src="/img/3.jpg" alt="Deer family - driving in to Yosemite National Park" title="Deer family - driving in to Yosemite National Park"></p>
<p><img src="/img/4.jpg" alt="Deer family - driving in to Yosemite National Park" title="Deer family - driving in to Yosemite National Park"></p>
<p>as if that’s not the cutest!</p>
<p>###As <em>John Muir</em> said:</p>
<p>“Keep close to Nature’s heart… and break clear away, once in a while.<br>Climb a mountain, spend a week in the woods. Wash your spirit clean”</p>
<p>Sounds perfect…</p>
