The Seahawks had just come from behind to make it into the Super Bowl and it seemed like a good excuse to get out of San Fran and hit the town.</strong></h5>
<p><em>Note: flew Alaskan. Nabbed some Qantas points for our troubles (sweet).</em> </p>
<p>For many of us our only experience of Seattle is as the home of the lovely forresty surrounds of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV_GvndKuDQ" target="_blank" rel="external">Seattle Grace Hospital</a>, or as the setting of Rob Reiner and Tom Hanks’ <em>famous</em> (I think it’s famous) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lG1CTmaQEE" target="_blank" rel="external">stroll towards Pike Place Market</a> as they discuss TH’s butt and a sex move called tira misu (fun fact: not actually a sex move according to director Nora Roberts, we all need to get our minds out of the gutter. Or I do.) </p>
<p><strong>Either way, you may be thinking “Seattle?”, “hit the town?”, “there’s a night life in Seattle?” and “what is this far-off magical place on the other side of the universe?” “Do they have beer?”</strong></p>
<p>Oh! So many questions, and I have the answers! Yes there is beer. Yes there is a nightlife. There is coffee, and great food, and art, and music!</p>
<p>We stayed in an AirBNB close to  downtown near Alaskan Way, which runs along the waterfront and is close to the market and everything you need.</p>
<p>Us at Pike Place…</p>

<p>Look how much fun we’re having - I have no idea what we’re laughing at but it makes me want to be on vacation again!!</p>
<h1 id="Art!">Art!</h1>

<p><strong>I’ve found that there are always stacks of artsy goings-on in Seattle. Above is a series at International District Station we found on our way from the city to Sea Tac airport. (Sonya Ishii - designed to represent origami that is being folded!)</strong></p>
<p>During other Seattle trips Rob and I have visited <a href="http://instagram.com/seattleartmuseum" target="_blank" rel="external">Seattle Art Museum (SAM)</a> which has some fantastic travelling exhibitions – in 2011 I saw the Musée National Picasso collection, which was obviously super impressive. We also saw <a href="pic.twitter.com/SSJYqDt0hT">Seattle Symphony Orchestra</a> and Chorus at Benroya Hall – very cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/visit/olympic-sculpture-park" target="_blank" rel="external">SAM’s Olympic Park</a> stretches along the beautiful waterfront with outdoor instalations, sculptures and art works. Here are some photos from our visit last year.</p>

<p>I don’t think the boys were too sure about this one…</p>
<p><img src="/img/OlympicPark2.jpg" alt="Olympic Park walking" title="Olympic Park walking"></p>
<p>If you have a car you should check out artsy hipster <a href="http://fremont.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Fremont</a> (north of Seattle) for awesome <a href="http://instagram.com/caffevitaseattle" target="_blank" rel="external">Vita coffee</a> and brunch as well as community arts projects like the famous Fremont Troll under the George Washington Bridge and the Lenin statue in the main square.</p>
<p>As you can see I personally had a great time climbing the troll…</p>

<p><strong>So, for a super pricey dinner the revolving restaurant at the top of the Space Needle is very fancy with amazing views of course of the Sound, the other lakes and surrounding mountains</strong></p>
<p>For brunch, Belltown is a neighbourhood close to downtown Seattle with about a billion brunch spots. Capitol Hill is also really good for cafes, restauraunts and bars.</p>
<p>Of course, the market is amazing for fresh seafood, fish, fruit and veg. The restaurants and bars are a bit <em>interesting</em> but have amazing views of the Sound and often the food is good if you can pick it. </p>
<p>The first ever Starbucks is at the market. But if you actually want some real coffee I had THE NUMBER ONE BEST machiatto I’ve ever had in the States at <a href="http://instagram.com/storyville/?modal=true" target="_blank" rel="external">Storyville</a> (in that it was an actual <em>machiatto</em>, not something the barrista just made up. Just sayin! I know I can be a coffee snob but seriously you guys). The magical place is located in the Corner Market Building </p>
<p><img src="/img/StoryvilleCoffee.jpg" alt="Storyville machiatto" title="Storyville machiatto"> </p>
<p>There is a warren of restaurants and bars and shops in that building – Seattle is genius at making sure you never have to go outside in the rain.</p>
<p>Pike Place brewery is also right there and there’s a funky hipster pub at the stairs.</p>
<p>All of these places back on to the infamous and totally gross “Gum Wall”, which is exactly what it sounds like.</p>
<p>Here are some photos.</p>
<p><img src="/img/CanvaGumWall.jpg" alt="Gum Wall" title="Gum Wall"></p>
<p>I know – <em>ew!</em></p>
<p>I promised beer… </p>
<h1 id="Brewery_Tour!">Brewery Tour!</h1>
<p><strong>We had a lot of fun Saturday taking a brewery tour with <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/road-dogs-seattle-brewery-tours-seattle" target="_blank" rel="external">Road Dogs Brewery Tour</a> and Brian our lovely tour guide.</strong> </p>
<p>We checked out <a href="https://bigalbrewing.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Big Al</a>, a micro-brewery of house-brewed beers, <a href="http://seapinebrewing.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Seapine</a>, with classic stylised artisan brews, and <a href="http://www.hilliardsbeer.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hilliards</a>, with game day beers and onsite canning – all micro-establishments with opportunities to check out the back end and to see the brewing process close up. </p>
<p><img src="/img/CanvaBeer.jpg" alt="RoadDogs breweries" title="RoadDogs breweries"></p>
<p><img src="/img/BigAl.jpg" alt="Big Al&#39;s" title="Big Al&#39;s"></p>
<p>Washington state (of which Seattle is the capital) is a big producer and exporter of hops. It is home to over 281 breweries – second only in number to California, which has the most breweries of any state. I usually LOVE stouts and porters, but I had the only India Pale Ale I have ever (EVER) liked at Big Al. Hoppy but smooth rather than bitter. The stout at Seapine was also super yummy.</p>
<p><em>Fun fact: Brian told us that IPAs came about when British colonialists brewed beer on the ships to India to make up for there being no beer brewed in the colony. Facinated? I know, beer trivia is awesome!</em></p>
<h1 id="Now_to_the_actual_reason_we_went_to_Seattle_in_the_first_place…">Now to the actual reason we went to Seattle in the first place…</h1>
<p><strong>It goes without saying that watching the Seahawks lose was very sad</strong> – though watching Katy Perry smash Bruno Mars out of the park (mixed sporting metaphors) with a performance that was (as Artem pointed out, strangely reminiscent of GI Joe - but in my (Liv’s) opinion still) <em>AWESOME</em> certainly made up for it.</p>
<p>I still don’t quite understand rivalries here but apparently as a San Fran resident and default ‘9ers fan I should have been barracking for the other team any way.</p>
<p>My bad.</p>
<p>So that was our Seattle trip!<br>Let me know in the comments what you think.<br>In the meantime I now have a total craving for a Meg Ryan rom-com…</p>
