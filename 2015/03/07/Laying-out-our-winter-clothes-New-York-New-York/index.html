    <section class="post-content">
      <p>As smells of spring fill the air; as poppies bloom in corals and orange hues, and the sea salt spray permeates the soft sunny breezes from San Fran’s ocean-side Sunset District to North Beach, California Boulevard and the South Bay - we left the west (and towns we love the best) for New York town, New York.</p>
<p><img src="/img/NYC2015.png" alt="New York City 2015: Laying out our winter clothes - New York, New York" title="New York City 2015: Laying out our winter clothes - New York, New York"></p>
<p><strong><em>“People goin’ down to the ground<br><br>Buildings goin’ up to the sky<br><br>Wintertime in New York town…”</em></strong><br><br><br><em>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzW8wvRJI1w" target="_blank" rel="external">Thanks Bob!</a>)</em><br></p>
<p>Greenwich Village, the lower east side, Chelsea, SoHO, Battery Park, Brooklyn Bridge, Williamsburg “sigh!”, the Upper West Side, Central Park in the snow, Strawberry Feilds, the Met, the Upper East Side, Lincoln Center, Broadway…</p>
<p>Aw maaaaaaan. Even with frost biting at my wrists - the uncovered spot between my gloves and my jacket, rookie mistake - even with the snow freezing our noses and the wind freezing our bones the eclectic energy and excitement and general awesomeness of the city could never be diminished.</p>
<p>Just taking an uber/taxi from JFK International to Manahattan is an experience - across the Queenborough from Queens driving down Park Avenue counting down the streets (<em>“Oooooooh 5th Avenue, FIFTH AVENUE!!!”</em> to quote my text to Rob, who was waiting at our hotel). </p>
<h4 id="First_stop:_Bars"><strong>First stop: Bars</strong><br></h4>
<h6 id="The_Heath_at_The_McKittrick_Hotel"><a href="http://http://m.mckittrickhotel.com/theheath/" target="_blank" rel="external">The Heath</a> at The McKittrick Hotel<br></h6>
<p>As soon as I arrived we were off! Chelsea is an amzing place to stay. The city is so easy to navigate. We walked to this bar on 27th and 10th…</p>
<p><img src="/img/TheHeath.jpg" alt="The Heath" title="The Heath"><br><em>Photos compiled from The Heath website</em></p>
<p>As we stepped in from the extreme cold of the lower west dock-side, the lift operator guided us forward and in a few moments we were back in the speakeasy twenties. To the left was an old train carriage, to the right a coatman (so civilized) with an accent (of course, hardly anyone is ever actually from here!) whose first advice was to check out upstairs - a fabulous guilded age rooftop bar called <a href="http://m.mckittrickhotel.com/gallowgreen/" target="_blank" rel="external">The Lodge</a> with glorious city views by open fires and a log cabin that would be at home in Tahoe. Fox skins on the walls and mulled wine to fight the -20 celsius chill. </p>
<p><img src="/img/TheLodge1.gif" alt="The Lodge" title="The Lodge"></p>
<p><em>Gif from The Lodge website that beautifully sumarises the cosy and amazing experiences.</em></p>
<p><img src="/img/TheLodge2.jpg" alt="Rob &amp; Liv at The Lodge" title="Rob &amp; Liv at The Lodge"></p>
<p>*Mulled wine! (I ended up ditching it and finishing Rob’s beer tbh - yay for husbands!)</p>
<p>The Heath itself is downstairs, the menu is classic comfort food with a modern edge - a hearty veg stew for vegetarians and amazing desserts (apple cobbler was amazing) - and a swing band improvising standards on the stage. Perfect!</p>
<p><img src="/img/TheHeath2.jpg" alt="The Heath" title="The Heath"></p>
<h3 id="Next_stop:_exploring_the_Upper_West_and_East_Sides"><strong>Next stop: exploring the Upper West and East Sides</strong><br></h3>
<p>From our hotel in Chelsea the subway was a totally easy option north - it’s a great way to explore because all the major stops are sights to see! And totally cheap.</p>
<h6 id="Central_Park_in_the_snow">Central Park in the snow</h6>
<p>From the subway at 86th and Broadway - amongst beautiful Victorian era Upper West-side houses lining wide streets (<em>very</em> different to Chelsea!!) - I walked through the park along the running track at the Jacqui Onassis Reservoir. </p>
<p><img src="/img/CPsnow2.png" alt="Central Park" title="Central Park"></p>
<p><img src="/img/CPsnow3.jpg" alt="Central Park" title="Central Park"></p>
<p>The reservoir was iced over except at the fountain in the middle. There was a lady feeding the birds (“hm hm hmm, tuppence a bag…”). It was eerily quiet, but serene and peaceful. The footprints in the snow testified to so many people who I’m sure commute through the park each day and yet, there was no one around. Probably the quietest spot in the whole city!</p>
<h6 id="The_Met!">The Met!</h6>
<p>There is absolutely nothing I can say to describe The Met. It makes me feel at peace with the world to know there is an institution protecting the world’s relics and art in such a holistic and profound way. Love it!</p>
<p><img src="/img/Met2.jpg" alt="The Met" title="The Met, Fifth Avenue"></p>
<p>Here is one of the spectacular pieces from the American Wing’s beautiful Engelhard Court on the Central Park side of the museum (first floor): <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/11476?rpp=30&amp;pg=1&amp;gallerynos=700&amp;rndkey=20150307&amp;ft=*&amp;pos=22" target="_blank" rel="external">Bacchante and Infant Faun</a><br><br>This is a beautiful part of the museum - particularly a good spot for a coffee break at the cafe nearby!</p>
<p><img src="/img/Met1.jpg" alt="Frederick William McMonnies&#39; Bacchante and Infant Faun, American Wing - The Charles Engelhard Court, The Met" title="Frederick William McMonnies&#39; Bacchante and Infant Faun, American Wing - The Charles Engelhard Court, The Met"></p>
<p>And some other pieces: from a beautiful window in the medieval collection <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/466580" target="_blank" rel="external">Scenes from the Legend of Saint Vincent of Saragossa and the History of His Relics</a></p>
<p><img src="/img/Met3.png" alt="Legend of Saint Vincent, Medieval Wing - The Met" title="Legend of Saint Vincent, Medieval Wing - The Met"></p>
<p>If I could, I would pitch a tent and live in the foyer - seriously even the foyer is <em>so</em> beautiful. </p>
<p>Or here on the steps…<br><img src="/img/Met6.jpg" alt="On the steps of The Met" title="On the steps of The Met"></p>
<h6 id="Lunch!_And_other_essentials">Lunch! And other essentials</h6>
<p>My mistake was attempting to use Yelp in NYC (seriously, does technology <em>only</em> work in San Francisco!?? Hehehe jks) and couldn’t find the supposed lunch place I was looking for on 5th. So I wandered up East 86th passed lovely Mad Avenue towards Lexington. I found this CUTE and quirky French restaurant with hot (key word: hot) asparagus soup, bread and a yummy bordeaux (well, when in a French resaurant on the Upper East Side!). The quirky menu complete with French <em>Asterix</em> excerpts: <a href="http://www.demarchelierrestaurant.com/food/" target="_blank" rel="external">Demarchelier</a>.<br><img src="/img/Demarchelier.png" alt="Liquid lunch at Demarchelier" title="Liquid lunch at Demarchelier"></p>
<h6 id="Flatiron_District">Flatiron District</h6>
<p>New York architecture is so amazing - not just because it’s beautiful, but because it provides an incredible window in the sociology of the time and the way people were thinking. The Flatiron District sits at the southern end of Mad Avenue and the building for which it is named of course is at the southern point of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Flatiron+Building/@40.74106,-73.989699,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xde2a6125ed704926" target="_blank" rel="external">Broadway and Fifth</a>. At 22 stories it was one of the first sky scrapers in New York - which makes it an incredible landmark in the history of modern engineering, that only 113 years ago 22 stories was considered as tall as it gets.</p>
<p>The terra cotta detailing is beautiful, and the neighbourhood around the building is really cool - great for exploring!</p>
<p><img src="/img/FI2.jpg" alt="Flatiron" title="Flatiron"></p>
<p><img src="/img/FI1.png" alt="Flatiron" title="Flatiron"></p>
<p>Empire State from the Flatiron Building…</p>
<p><img src="/img/FI5.jpg" alt="Flatiron" title="Flatiron"></p>
<p><img src="/img/FI7.jpg" alt="Flatiron" title="Flatiron"><br><em>Literally too cold to smile!!</em></p>
<h6 id="Dinner:_NYC-style_pizza_Vs_Farm-fresh_fast-food">Dinner: NYC-style pizza Vs Farm-fresh fast-food</h6>
<p>This is hard for me to say, because I love NYC-style pizza, but standing in sub-zero (celsius) conditions on the corner of Broadway and W 28th looking in the window of a cheap nyc-style pizza place with food that looked like it had been sitting in a dirty bain-marie all night we made the not-actually-too-hard-in-the-end decision to try a farm-to-table wallet-friendly New York chain called <a href="https://www.diginn.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Dig Inn</a>.<br><br> With yummy sandwiches - like the 5-spice meatball that Rob had - and veggie salads - like the amazing roasted brussel sproats, which was more my taste - Dig Inn is perfect PERFECT for travellers to the city. Before you succumb to crummy greasy burgers with undisclosed meat varieties and wilted “lettuce” check this out on your next NYC visit!</p>
<p><img src="/img/DigInn.png" alt="Dig Inn" title="Dig Inn"><br><em>When I’m out I am usually too distracted by eating to photograph food so these images are compiled from the Dig Inn press kit. They’re also totally not sponsoring this or anything - although if they did I wish they’d pay me in brussel sprouts and sweet potato, those look DIVINE</em></p>
